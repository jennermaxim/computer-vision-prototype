INPUT: Image of a street with visible litter and waste

VISION ANALYSIS OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
DETECTED ISSUES:

1. Environment - Severe Street Littering (High Severity)
   - Multiple plastic bottles, food wrappers, and general debris scattered
     across the road and sidewalk
   - Accumulation of waste near drainage areas
   - Poor waste disposal infrastructure visible

2. Environment - Blocked Drainage System (Medium Severity)
   - Visible blockage of street drainage grates by plastic waste
   - Potential flooding risk during rain
   - Standing water in some areas indicating poor drainage

VISUAL EVIDENCE:
- Clear accumulation of plastic waste materials in multiple locations
- Absence of waste bins in visible areas
- Unmanaged waste disposal creating unsanitary conditions
- Mixed household and commercial waste visible on street

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement regular street cleaning schedule
2. Install adequate waste bins along the street
3. Clear blocked drainage systems immediately
4. Community education on proper waste disposal
5. Establish waste collection points

CLASSIFICATION:
Category: Environment
Confidence: High
Reasoning: The primary issues relate to waste management and environmental
sanitation, clearly falling under environmental concerns.

GENERATED MISSION STATEMENT:
"Transform our community streets from polluted, hazardous areas into clean,
sustainable public spaces by implementing a comprehensive waste management
system that engages local residents, establishes proper disposal infrastructure,
and creates lasting environmental awareness to reduce street pollution by 80%
within 12 months."

ACTION STEPS:
1. Organize community cleanup initiative within 2 weeks
2. Install 20 waste bins at strategic locations
3. Establish weekly waste collection schedule
4. Launch environmental awareness campaign
5. Create youth ambassador program for sustainability

To eliminate recurring flood hazards in our community by designing and 
implementing a sustainable drainage system that protects residents, property, 
and infrastructure while creating a model for urban water management that can 
be replicated in similar neighborhoods.

Problem Definition:
Inadequate drainage infrastructure causes persistent flooding during rainfall, 
endangering residents' safety, damaging property, and disrupting daily life.

Goal:
Implement a comprehensive drainage solution that prevents 95% of flooding 
incidents within one year, while engaging the community in sustainable water 
management practices.

Expected Impact:
- Improved safety and quality of life for 500+ residents
- Protection of property valued at $2M+
- Reduced health risks from standing water
- Enhanced community resilience to climate challenges
- Creation of educational model for neighboring areas

Action Steps:
1. Conduct detailed drainage survey and hydrological assessment
2. Design community-appropriate drainage system with engineer input
3. Secure funding through municipal grants and community contributions
4. Implement drainage improvements with local labor involvement
5. Establish maintenance protocol and monitoring system""",
